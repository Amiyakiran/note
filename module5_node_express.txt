NODE AND EXPRESS
----------------

Backend concept
    --------------
    - client -server Architecture - sending request and response between application
    - api - application programming interface
    - RESTful api - http request - json formate.
    - CRUD - create read update delete. operate - 
    - CORS - Cross origin resourse sharing.

 MVC Architecture
     -----------------
     1) VIEW - send the Request 
     2) ROUTING - set path to resolve the  request    
     3) CONTROLLER - set the logic to resolve the request   
     4) MODEL - structure to store data.
     5) DATABASE - used to store data.


NODE

-  not a programming Language
-  it provides a run time Environment fOR javaScript to run outside the Browser 
-  with Some javaScript Libraries.

Installation
------------
https://nodejs.org/en/download

Features
--------
 - extremely fast -  mutiple request can be resolved - v8
 - based on Asyncgronous Programming'
 - singled threaded
 - Highly Scalable - 
 - open source-


  extension - filename.js

 what are node Modules
  ---------------------
  -modules are files/javaScript Libraries in node.js.
  - if we want to include this module in our file we need to import that module.
    import  - require('path')
    export - module.exports

 - type of modules
 -------------------
   1) custome Modules
   2) BuildIn Modules.

  Type of BuildIn Modules
  -----------------------
  1) file System Module:
     -------------------
      - allow us to worl with the files inside your program/file/computer
      - import
       syntax
       ---------
        keyword variable = require('fs')

        common uses

         1) Read files  - fs.readFile()
         2) to create files - fs.open()
         3) Update file  - fs.writeFile()   
         4) Delete file - fs.unlink()
         5) Rename file - fs.rename()
         
    2) http module
       ---------------
       -  Allows Node.js to transfer data over http request.
       - http module can create an http server that listens to server ports and gives a response back to the client.
        - method - createServer() - to create server.
                 - listen() - to listen to the server port   
    3) https module - more secured protocol will be allowed and accept https request    
    4) Event Modules - To Generate Events
         - class EventEmitter () 
             -object - new classname
             - to create an event  - object.on()
             - execute - emit()  
    5) crypto - tool to encryption, hashing


Global Objects
--------------
- In Node.js, the global object represents the global scope, and it provides global variables and functions that are available throughout your application. 
- Eg - console in console.log - display content
     - setTimeout and setInterval -These functions are used for scheduling code execution after a specified delay or at regular intervals.
     - clearTimeout and clearInterval - Used to stop the execution of a scheduled timeout or interval.
     - __dirname and __filename - These variables provide the directory and filename of the currently executing script.
     -  global - The global object itself can be used to define global variables.
     - process - The process object provides information and control over the current Node.js process.
     - require and module - These are used for module management in Node.js.


environmental variables
------------------------
- Environment variables are predetermined values that are typically used to provide the ability to configure a value in your code from outside of your application.
- Environment variables provide information about the environment in which the process is running. 






EXPRESS

- flexible web application framework for Node.js

how to setup a server using node and express
--------------------------------------------

npm install -y
npm install dotenv cors express mangoose

.gitignore
.env file
db folder - connection.js
routes - router.js
controller - production.js
models




index.js
----------

//Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. 

require('dotenv').config();


//import express
const express = require('express')

//import cors
const cors = require('cors')

//import router
const router = require('./Routes/router')
/* const appMiddleware = require('./middleware/appMiddleware') */

//import mongoose
require('./DB/connections')


//create expressServer -Creates an Express application. The express() function is a top-level function exported by the express module.

const pfServer = express()
//cors is used by server
pfServer.use(cors())
//parsing json -Returns middleware that only parses json and only looks at requests where the Content-Type header matches the type option.(CONTENT-TYPE - APLLICATION/JSON) - convert into javaScript understanding object
pfServer.use(express.json())

//middleware appmiddleware - only me
/* pfServer.use(appMiddleware) */

//use router in server
pfServer.use(router)

//export uploads
//first arg - how other apllication should use it 
//second argument - to export that file from server
pfServer.use('/uploads',express.static('./uploads'))

//customize port- bydefault - 3000

const PORT = 4000 || process.env.PORT

//run server app
pfServer.listen(PORT,()=>{
    console.log(`SERVER RUNNING SUCCESSFULLY AT PORT NUMBER ${PORT}`);
})

//http get request resolving to http://localhost:4000/ 
pfServer.get('/',(req,res)=>{
    res.send(`<h1 style="color:green;">Project server started and waiting fro client server !! </h1>`)
})

/* //post request
pfServer.post('/',(req,res)=>{
   res.send("post requested")
})




 CORS
------
- CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. It is a security feature implemented by web browsers to control how web pages in one domain can request and interact with resources hosted on another domain.
- in simple terms connect and controls the request flow between the frontend and the server.



creating and handling routes
---------------------------
Creating and handling routes in an Express.js server involves defining routes for different URL paths and specifying the corresponding actions or middleware functions to execute when those routes are accessed. 

Servername.httprequest('path',logic to exeute in this path)
})
eg:
    pfServer.post('/',(req,res)=>{
   res.send("post requested")
})
	



MIDDLEWARES
--------------
- middleware is a function which have access to request response cycle.
- it have three arguments -
   1) first argument - request
   2) second - response
   3) thrid - next - only after calling next the control will be given to the next function in req-res cycle.
- position of these arguments are important

Two type of middleware
----------------------
1) application specific - it effect the entire application - so each and every request will go through middleware
2) router specific - affect only a particular path



CRUD Operations
---------------
C - create - post http request
R - read - get http request
U - update - put http request
D - Delete - delete http request



Authentication (JWT)
--------------------
JWT - JSON WEB TOKEN
--------------------
JWTs are commonly used in modern web applications to securely transmit information between the client and the server.
- token creation
    - import jwt library - const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken')
    - sign algorithm is used to create token which have basically two arguments -1) data to be stored inside token 
                                                                                - 2) secrete key 
    eg: jwt.sign({userId:existingUser._id},"supersecretkey12345")
- verify token
    - verify method is used
    - first argument is the token to be verified and the second argument must be the secrete key
       eg:  jwt.verify(token,"supersecretkey12345")
