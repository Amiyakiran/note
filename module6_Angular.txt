ANGULAR
---------
- Angular is a popular open-source web application framework 
- Developed and maintained by Google. 
- It is written in TypeScript 
- helps to build dynamic single-page web applications (SPAs).
- latest version - angular 17 - nov
- use real DOM


Basic Commands
--------------
Angular CLI is a command-line tool that simplifies the process of creating, building, and deploying Angular applications. It provides commands for generating components, services, modules, and more.
    - ng v - to check the version
    - npm install -g @angular/cli- lastest version.
    - npm uninstall -g @angular/cli - to uninstall the angular cli
    - npm install -g @angular/cli@version - to get the particular version.

- To create a project - ng new project-name
    - routing - yes - if you need to setup path
    - stylesheet -css
- to run a project - ng serve 
    - to run and open in default browser - ng serve --open
                                         - ng s -o  

- create components - ng g c component-name
- create services - ng g s  foldername/servicename or ng g s servicename
- create pipe - ng g p foldername/pipename
- create guards - ng g g foldername/guardname



TypeScript
----------
- JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, meaning that variable types are determined at runtime.Where as TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language. 
- JavaScript code is executed directly by browsers for client-side scripting or by server-side environments like Node.js.Where as TypeScript code needs to be compiled into JavaScript before it can be executed. This compilation step is done using the TypeScript compiler  

 files in Angular Applications
 -----------------------------
 1).gitignore - hold the file name which doesnot need to mobe to git.
 2) .editorConfig - vscode configuration
 3) package.json
 4) package-lock.json  
 5) README - discription
 6) tsconfig - typeScript configuration
 7) node_module
 8) src
     - index.html - only page that render.
     - style.css - global styling
     - main.ts - global behaviour
     - app component
         - app.component.html - to create content
         - app.component.css - to create style.
         - app.component.ts - to give behaviour
         - app.component.spec.ts - for testing purpose
- app-routing.module.ts - path specify

9)  angular.json - angular configuration.
10) app.module.ts - holds thrid party contents(components, libraries etc...)


Module
------
Angular applications are organized into modules, which help in organizing code and managing dependencies. A module encapsulates related components, services, and directives.


Components and Life cycles,
---------------------------

- Components are the basic building blocks of angular application.
- components are created using the command - ng g c component-name
- Each component consist of four files
    - 1) .html file - for creating the content
    - 2) .css file - for styling the content
    - 3) .ts file - for writing the logic
    - 4) .spec.ts file - for testing purpose


Lifecycle event sequence
------------------------
After your application instantiates a component or directive by calling its constructor, Angular calls the hook methods you have implemented at the appropriate point in the lifecycle of that instance.

refer : https://angular.io/guide/lifecycle-hooks


Data binding
------------
data binding is the way of data sharing within a component

1) one way data binding
    1) ts(component)- html(view)
        - string Interpolation - {{}}
        - property binding 
             [attribute]= "value"
    2) html(view) -ts(component)
       - data sharing using events - (event) = "value"
       - data sharing using $events - (event) ="value($event)"
       - template variable - #variable - placed on tag

2) two way data binding
    - data sharing in both direction - 
    - acheived using [(ngModel)]
    - formsModule is import to get [(ngModel)] 
    - must give name attribute to the input tag



Dependency Injection
---------------------
- data sharing between component and a predefined class /class
- syntax 
    - constructor(access-specifier componentsproperty:dependentclass){}
- if dependency injection is done in function the inject method is used
 - syntax 
    - const variable = inject(dependentclass)

   
Directives
----------
 - is used to give additional behaviour to the html documents.

 - there are three type of Directive
        - 1) component Directive
        - 2) Structural Directive
        - 3) Attribute directive.

- structure - conditional rendering
   - *ngIf
   - *ngFor  - for item of arrayname
   - *ngSwitch

- attribute directive - used to provide styles to html elements - ngClass

 

Services
--------
- used to share data between two components.
- command - ng g s foldername/servicename
- They are injectable and can be used across multiple components.


Routing
------- 
- Angular provides a router module for handling navigation and defining routes. This enables the creation of single-page applications with multiple views.
- set path in the app-routing.module.ts as objects
   eg:  {
    	  path:'path',component:Componentname
  	}
- routerLink in the html tags
- Router class can also be used for navigation - eg: navigateByUrl('path')


Angular Forms
--------------
Angular includes powerful form-handling features, allowing developers to easily create and validate forms. It supports both template-driven forms and reactive forms.

1) template driven
   - Template-driven forms are based on directives in the template and are less explicit than reactive forms.
   - Suitable for simpler scenarios, where the logic is primarily handled in the template. 
   - import FormsModule in your module to use template-driven forms
        // app.module.ts
	import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';

	@NgModule({
  		imports: [FormsModule],
  	// ...
	})
    - create variable in the ts file
    - bind the varaible in the hmtl file using ngModel

2) Model driven (reactive forms)
    - Reactive forms are more explicit and offer greater control over form logic. 
    - They are suitable for complex forms and scenarios where you need to handle form controls programmatically.
    - Import ReactiveFormsModule in your module to use reactive forms.
	// app.module.ts
	import { ReactiveFormsModule } from '@angular/forms';

	@NgModule({
  	imports: [ReactiveFormsModule],
  	// ...
	})
    - Dependency inject FormBuilder and create formGroup
    - in .html file Bind form controls using formControlName and name attribute


pipes
-----
- They are simple functions that take an input (the data to be transformed) and return a modified output.
- Pipes can be used to format data, manipulate strings, perform mathematical operations, and more.
- Angular have both built-in pipes as well as costume pipes
  built-in pipes -eg: Date ,UpperCasePipe and LowerCasePipe, CurrencyPipe etc
- symbol - |
- command to create pipe - ng g p foldername/pipename



Asynchronous function â€“ Observable, 
------------------------------------
- Angular extensively uses observables for handling asynchronous operations. Observables are used for events, data streams, and handling responses from HTTP requests.
- They are part of the Reactive Extensions for JavaScript (RxJS) library, which is commonly used in Angular applications.
- created using the Observable class in RxJS. 
- To receive values from an observable, you need to subscribe to it
- it can be partial observable(except all series response) or call back arrow function(only 200 series)
- Advantage of Observable over promise is - observable can resolve multiple request at a time where as in promise only one request


Http Client
-----------
Angular includes an HTTP client module for making HTTP requests to servers. It provides a convenient way to communicate with backend services and APIs.


Angular Guards
--------------
- In Angular, guards are used to control access to certain routes or components based on certain conditions.
- There are several types of guards in Angular, including
	1) CanActivate: This guard is used to determine if a route can be activated. It is often used to check if a user is authenticated before allowing access to a particular route.

	2) CanActivateChild: Similar to CanActivate, but specifically used to guard child routes.

	3) CanDeactivate: Used to determine if a route can be deactivated. This is often used to confirm with the user before leaving a form with unsaved changes.

	4) CanLoad: Used to check if a lazy-loaded module can be loaded.

	5) Resolve: Used to perform data fetching before the route is activated.



Behaviour Subject
-----------------
- In Angular, a BehaviorSubject is a type of observable that stores the latest value emitted and allows subscribers to access it even if they subscribe after the value has been emitted. 
- It's a part of the RxJS library, which is often used in Angular for handling asynchronous operations.
- WORKING
  1) Initialization:
     import { BehaviorSubject } from 'rxjs';

     const mySubject = new BehaviorSubject('Initial Value');
   2) Accessing: 
	mySubject.subscribe(value => {
  		console.log('Received value:', value);
	});
    3) Updating the Value:
	mySubject.next('New Value');
